# Test-Driven Development with Jasmine

This project, last one of Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree, is meant to train developers to use test-driven environments to write their code in an efficient way. The app provided with the course package is a simple RSS feed with 4 feeds as sources. The idea was to complete the test environments by writing a series of suites and tests with [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).  

## Getting Started

Simply download the repository and launch index.html in your favorite browser to run the app. The test environment will be displayed at the bottom of the page. If all tests are passed, the app should run error-free. If one bug appears, the corresponding test should then fail, indicating where the bug is located.

### Prerequisites

No prerequisite appart from an internet connection.

## Built With

* HTML5/CSS3
* [jQuery library](http://api.jquery.com/) for DOM manipulations
* [Jasmine 2.1.2](https://jasmine.github.io/2.1/introduction) for the testing environment
